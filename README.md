My first ever go code. School project, searching for results may be sql injection vulnerable and overally dashboard may be vulnerable to potential xss attacks. Even tho it is only a homework I am about to fix it soon.

I tried to split project structure to make it similar to nestjs structure, because I enjoy it the most.
